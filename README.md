## Fizzbuzz - Javascript
-----

## Task
-----

Solving the Fizzbuzz challenge with Test Driven Development, using Javascript
and the testing framework Jasmine.

## Requirements
-----
```
All numbers divisible by 3 should return 'fizz'

All numbers divisible by 5 should return 'buzz'

All numbers divisible by both 3 & 5 should return 'fizzbuzz'

All other numbers remain unchanged
```

## Setup
-------
From your terminal:
```
cd projects
git clone git@github.com:CKKH/fizzbuzz_javascript.git
cd fizzbuzz_javascript
```
Load SpecRunner.html (found in the project's root) in your favourite browser to see the passing
tests.

## Approach

Used the red green cycle of TDD to solve Fizzbuzz one requirement at a time.

## To do

Refactor the tests and src file.
